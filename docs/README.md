# Documentation

Here, you will find general documentation for working with the codebase. If you
want to know something specific about an API, see the README.md file for the
package it's from.

If you don't know which package a function is from, use the find-in-files
feature (in most editors) with either `stock` or `forward` prefixing the
function name depending on if it's a action or an event.

that the project managers will like.
